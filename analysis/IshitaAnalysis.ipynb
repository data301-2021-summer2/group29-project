    "\n",
    "- There does not appear to be a causal relationsip or a correlation amongst the different regions in the United States and the medical charges people incur in those areas. However, it is apparent that the 'southeast' region has a higher medical cost. This could be explored by experts, who could conduct research and collect more data to better understand this relationship.\n",
    "- There appears to be a strong correlation among whether the person is a smoker and their medical charges. However, when the data was analyzed, it was found that the number of non-smokers in the dataset were far greater than the number of smokers. This difference in the count could also be a factor in this vast difference in the medical costs."
