The **Analysis_task4.md** file is where we have compiled our final analysis for Task 4 of Milestone 2

The `scripts` directory contains the project_functions.py file which contains the function we made. Currently it only has the `load_and_process()` function to process our dataset.

The directories `Ishita Gupta` and `Prabhmeet Deol` consist of our individual EDA's performed in our respective folders, as part of Milestone 2.
