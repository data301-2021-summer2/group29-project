**Update - 11 August 2021:** 
- Milestone2.ipynb file has all the data analysis performed along with the final processing of data to be used in the Tableau Dashboard.
- The `scripts` directory in the `analysis` folder has the updated project_functions.py file that can be used by both members of the team to use the `load_and_process()` function. Thus, the scripts directory in this folder can be ignored.

*July 31 2021*:
- All my data analysis for Milestone 2 is in the Milestone2.ipynb file.
- The ImportFunctions.ipynb file is a notebook to import the functions I made.
- The scripts directory contains the project_functions.py file which contains all the functions I make. Currently, it only has the `load_and_process()` function.
